### How I worked
I worked for sections and every section their own properties, method: <br>
• Section design<br>
• Develop section<br>
• Section responsive<br>
• Check section<br>
• Commit<br>
• Next section<br>

I tried to keep everything as simple as possible

#### Technologies used:
<br>
• HTML5<br>
• CSS3<br>
• Sass<br>
• Javascript<br>
• jQuery<br>

I didn't use Bootstrap to show my ability to create cool responsive web pages by my own
